# Password-cracking-wordlist
 A password cracking wordlist is a list of commonly used passwords that are used by password crackers to try to guess passwords. Password crackers are tools that attempt to guess passwords by trying a large number of possible passwords.

The code first imports the string and itertools modules. The string module provides a number of functions for working with strings, such as the ascii_letters and digits functions, which return all the lowercase letters and digits, respectively. The itertools module provides a number of functions for working with iterators, such as the product function, which returns the cartesian product of two or more iterables.

The code then defines a variable called val, which is assigned the concatenation of the ascii_letters, digits, and punctuation strings. This variable contains all the characters that can be used to create passwords.

The code then iterates over the range from 1 to 3. This means that the code will generate passwords of length 1, 2, and 3.

For each length, the code iterates over the product of the val string repeated the specified number of times. This means that the code will generate all possible combinations of characters for the specified length.

For each combination of characters, the code creates a string and appends it to a file called password.txt.

The code then closes the file.
